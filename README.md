# How did we fix DRM in Portugal (and so can you)

This is a presentation made by [ANSOL](https://ANSOL.org) about the Portuguese DRM law, presented in the "EU FOSS policy meeting" which happened in February 2019 in Brussels.

The presentation was updated to be presented at the Pre-FOSDEM event organised by Free Software Foundation Europe and held on 31 January 2020, 13:30 to 19:00 at MundoB, Edinburgh Street 26, in Brussels.
